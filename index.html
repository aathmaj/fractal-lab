        <p>
          A fractal is a complex, never-ending pattern that is self-similar
          across different scales. This means that if you zoom in on any part of
          the pattern, you'll see a smaller version of the whole. They are
          generated by repeating a simple iterative process, which leads to
          intricate details and infinite complexity. Fractals are not just
          mathematical curiosities; they are found throughout nature in forms
          like snowflakes, coastlines, lightning bolts, and the branching of
          trees.

          On this site, you can dive into two of the most famous examples of
          fractals, the Julia Set and the Mandelbrot Set. These visual
          representations of complex numbers reveal stunning, chaotic beauty
          born from simple rules.
